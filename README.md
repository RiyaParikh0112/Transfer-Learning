# Transfer Learning ðŸ§©

Transfer learning is a deep learning technique where we use pre-trained model. This pre-trained model is trained for one task and can be re-trained for a similar task with a smaller dataset.


## Examples of a Pre-trained dataset

- VGG-16
- ResNet 50
- Inceptionv3
- MobileNet V2
